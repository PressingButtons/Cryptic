Thoughts on Game system

Game is the overarching system (1 unique instance)
  - holds UIControllers (4)
  - holds Graphics
  - generates GameMatches
  - loads Object Data

Match - system over battles
  - holds object list
  - holds match rules
  - records win loss record if matchtype is valid
  - prototype for specific match types(?)

UIController -
